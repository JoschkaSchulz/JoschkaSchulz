### Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

It's me, Joschka. I'm a Ruby developer based in the rainy city of Hamburg, Germany. I love writing and testing new things. 

If you want to have a beer and talk about code, you can find me at the ruby usergroup in hamburg or at conferences like ruby kaigi in japan or ruby unconf in hamburg.

I'm currently writing a small tool to help Dungeon and Dragon players create characters. Wish me luck that I get it to a releasable version and not start another thing that interests me :D
